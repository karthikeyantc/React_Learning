> This is a repo for my React learning. Here I will update my daily progress and learnings. I will also add some useful resources that I find on the internet.

## Topics Covered

- **Reconciliation** - React's process of syncing changes in the application state with the DOM. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)
- **Virtual DOM** - Lightweight representation of Real DOM, used by React to minimize direct manipulation of the DOM. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html#what-is-the-virtual-dom)
- **JSX** - Syntax extension for JavaScript, used in React to describe what the UI should look like. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
- **JSX syntax** - The syntax used in JSX, similar to HTML. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
- **Components** - Reusable pieces of code that return a React element to be rendered to the page. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- **Child Components** - Components that are nested within other components. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

### **1/11/2024**

- **Props** - Properties, short for properties, are inputs to a React component. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- **Children Props** - Special prop that allow components to be passed as data to other components. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
- **Events** - Built-in constructs like onClick, onChange, etc. that handle user interactions. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
- **State** - A component's state is data that can change over time, and it is private and fully controlled by the component. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
- **useState** - Hook that lets you add React state to function components. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
- **Forms** - Single/Multi State, Two way data binding in forms using useState. Forms in React provide a way to gather input from the user and maintain state. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)
- **Parent to Child communication** - Props are used to pass data from parent to child. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- **Child to Parent communication** - Callbacks (Passing function as props) also known as lifting state up. This is a way for child to send some data back up to the parent. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)
- **List Rendering** - Rendering lists of data using map() function. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
- **Stateful list** - List that is rendered using state. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
- **Keys** - Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity. It is a special prop that's reserved by React. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

### **1/12/2024**

- **Filter List** - Filter list based on user input. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
- **Conditional Rendering** - Rendering different components based on a condition. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
- **Conditional Rendering for Forms** - Conditional rendering for forms based on user input or actions. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
- **Conditional Rendering using && operator** - In React, you can create elements conditionally using the `&&` operator. This technique allows you to inline render a component or element only when a certain condition is met. [Learn more about conditional rendering in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
- **Fragment** - Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. [Learn more](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html)
> **Note:** I decided to use typescript with react. So I will be learning typescript along with react. I will be using typescript in all my react projects from now on.
- **Typescript** - Typescript is a superset of javascript that adds types to javascript. [Learn more](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
- **Typescript with React** - Typescript can be used with react to add types to react components. [Learn more](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)
- **Props with Typescript** - Props can be typed in typescript using interfaces. [Learn more](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html)
- **useState with Typescript** - useState can be typed in typescript using generics. [Learn more](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#using-utility-types)
- **events with Typescript** - Events can be typed in typescript using generics. [Learn more](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#using-utility-types)
